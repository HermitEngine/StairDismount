## Purpose

This project was created as a derivative clone of [Stair Dismount Classic](http://secretexit.com/freestuff.html). The main purpose is for evaluation of my non-existent Unreal Engine 4 expertise. The secondary purpose it to actually learn and try out Unreal Engine 4 now that I have an excuse to do so.

It is highly **not recommended** that you use this code as basis for learning or establishment of best practices given that at the time of writing, I have absolutely no idea what I am doing. That said, I'm not the boss of you, so do what you like, as long as you do not violate the [LICENSE](LICENSE.txt).

## Pre-Requisites

The tools I used to create this project are:

- Unreal Engine 4.27.0
- Microsoft Visual Studio Community 2019 Version 16.4.2

## Additional notes
